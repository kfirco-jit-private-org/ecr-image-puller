# Java Prerequisite Check - Changes Summary

## Problem Identified
The application was failing to run with the error:
```
Unable to locate a Java Runtime.
Please visit http://www.java.com for information on installing Java.
```

## Changes Made

### 1. Updated Makefile
- Added a new `check-java` target that verifies Java is installed
- Made all relevant targets depend on `check-java`
- Created a `JAVA_CMD` variable for consistency
- Updated all Java command invocations to use the variable

### 2. Updated Shell Script (pull-images.sh)
- Added a check for Java installation at the beginning of the script
- Added helpful installation instructions if Java is not found

### 3. Updated README.md
- Added a new section with Java installation instructions for different operating systems:
  - macOS (using Homebrew)
  - Linux (Debian/Ubuntu)
  - Windows
- Added instructions for verifying Java installation

### 4. Updated Documentation
- Updated SUMMARY.md to include information about the prerequisite checks
- Updated FINAL_SUMMARY.md to reflect the enhanced error handling and user experience

## Benefits
- Improved user experience with clear error messages
- Provided helpful installation instructions
- Prevented cryptic errors when Java is missing
- Made the application more robust by checking prerequisites before execution

## Testing
- Verified that the `check-java` target works correctly
- Confirmed that the Makefile help command displays properly
- Ensured that the shell script is executable

## Next Steps
- Consider adding a version check to ensure Java 11+ is installed
- Consider adding a similar check for Maven in the build process
