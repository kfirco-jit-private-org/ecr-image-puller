# ECR Image Puller - Project Summary

## What We've Built

We've created a Java application that authenticates with AWS ECR and pulls Docker images to the local Docker environment. The application:

1. **Authenticates with AWS ECR** using credentials from a `.env` file or AWS default credential providers
2. **Supports temporary credentials** with session tokens
3. **Pulls Docker images in parallel** for improved performance
4. **Validates image names** and provides a list of available images
5. **Streams Docker output** to the console for real-time progress monitoring
6. **Verifies prerequisites** by checking for Java and Docker availability before running

## Key Components

1. **EcrImagePuller.java**: The main Java class that handles:
   - AWS ECR authentication
   - Docker command execution
   - Parallel image pulling
   - Error handling

2. **pom.xml**: Maven configuration file that:
   - Specifies AWS SDK dependencies
   - Configures the build process
   - Creates an executable JAR with dependencies

3. **pull-images.sh**: Shell script that:
   - Checks if Java is installed
   - Checks if Docker is running
   - Builds the application if needed
   - Runs the application with provided arguments

4. **Makefile**: Build automation tool that:
   - Provides targets for common operations
   - Organizes images by category (SAST, SCA, IaC, Secrets)
   - Simplifies the build and run process
   - Includes helpful documentation
   - Verifies Java and Docker availability

5. **README.md**: Documentation that includes:
   - Setup instructions
   - Java installation guides
   - Usage examples
   - Troubleshooting tips
   - Available images

## Features

- **Credential Flexibility**: Supports multiple ways to provide AWS credentials
- **Session Token Support**: Works with temporary credentials that require session tokens
- **Parallel Processing**: Pulls multiple images simultaneously for efficiency
- **User-Friendly Feedback**: Provides clear error messages and available options
- **Robust Error Handling**: Gracefully handles authentication failures and Docker issues
- **Categorized Image Management**: Organizes images by security scanning category
- **Multiple Run Options**: Supports running via Makefile, shell script, or direct Java command
- **Prerequisite Verification**: Checks for required dependencies before execution

## Testing Results

We've successfully tested the application with:
- Temporary AWS credentials (with session token)
- Multiple Docker images
- Invalid image names (which correctly displays available options)
- Various Makefile targets
- Prerequisite checks for Java and Docker

## Next Steps

Potential enhancements for the future:
1. Add logging with a proper logging framework
2. Implement a configuration file for customizing registry URLs and image mappings
3. Add a GUI interface for easier use
4. Implement image tagging and versioning support
5. Add support for multiple ECR registries
6. Create Docker Compose integration for running the security tools
